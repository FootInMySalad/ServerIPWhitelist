# ServerIPWhitelist

<sup>[SpigotMC Page](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/spigotipwhitelist.70579/)</sup>

A spigot plugin that allows you to limit IPs that players can connect to.



This plugin works like [IPWhitelist](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/ipwhitelist-1-7-1-14-protect-your-server-multicraft-and-sockets-support.65075/) but it is designed for servers that **don't** have BungeeCord.



## Config

`config.yml`

```yml
# The ip players are supposed to connect with.
# Should be in the form ip:port (port is required)
ip:

# Message to display when player gets kicked
kick-message:
```
